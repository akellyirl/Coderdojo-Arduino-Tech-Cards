# Coderdojo-Arduino-Tech-Cards
Tech Cards for teaching Arduino concepts. Designed for Coderdojo.

I developed Tech Cards along the lines of Coderdojo Sushi, but with a clear principle of one-card-one-concept in a handy A6 format.

The Concept cards introduce basic concepts and the Project cards present the users with a challenge to combine the concepts of the other cards to complete a Project. A simple Project example is to make an LED illuminate based on light level (LDR) by combining concepts such as conditionals (IF) and basic concepts (Blink).

The principles of one-card-one-concept and combination are deliberate and important. They contribute to learning in several ways: i) foundational concepts; ii) structured active learning; iii) encourages combination of ideas and concepts.

My experience is that these cards present kids with a purpose and structure. When forming the basis of activities in a supportive environment, where the kids can be guided through to completion, they have been very effective.

Please feel free to give feedback for further development or PULL requests with your own.
